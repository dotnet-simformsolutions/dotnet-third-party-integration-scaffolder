🧾 Task Definition

Scaffold the foundational Models, Helpers, and Documentation for a {ServiceName} integration. The generated structure and code should prioritize:
  - Modularity
  - Clarity
  - Reusability
  - Adherence to .NET and SOLID principles

📥 Inputs:
- {ServiceName}: Name of the third-party service (e.g., Stripe, QuickBooks).

📌 Code Generation Tasks

1. 🧾 Models Generation
Generate Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used to send and receive data from {ServiceName}. Place them under /Models/{ServiceName}.
Generate shared or common models used across services, not request/response DTOs. Place them under:
Examples:
  - EmailModel.cs → reusable structure for email payloads
  - TokenMetadata.cs → access token structure (for JWT/OAuth2)
  - StatusCodes.cs → centralized status code constants or enums
      
    🔹 Use clear, self-explanatory class and property names
    🔹 Group enums/consts appropriately
    🔹 Add XML documentation and inline C# comments for future maintainability

2. 🛠️ Helpers Generation
  ➤ Path:
        - /Services/{ServiceName}/Common/Helpers

✅ Guidelines:
  - Use static classes for stateless utilities (e.g., formatting, mapping)
  - Use singleton (registered via DI) if the helper has internal state or service dependencies
- Examples:
    - TokenHelper.cs → token acquisition logic for OAuth2/JWT
    - DateFormatter.cs f→ standardize date formats to match API spec
    - ValidationHelper.cs → reusable validation logic (e.g., required fields, formats)

  🔹  Each helper should include XML summary
  🔹 Logic should be isolated and testable

3. 📚 Documentation Update
➤ Path:
  - /Docs/README.md:
- List available models with example request/response structures
- Explain each helper and how/when to use it
- If middleware was created, describe its purpose and usage
- Use ### headers for each section and include C# code blocks

Output Format: 
- Output must be structured per task above
- Add inline C# comments for important logic in code
- Markdown sections should be clean, organized, and copy-paste ready

Tone: Maintain a formal, professional tone throughout the responses.

Constraints:
- Ensure all code fits within the proper namespace and directory structure
- No business logic or API call implementation here — only scaffolding
- Before creating any file, folder, project, or solution:
    - Check whether it already exists
    - If it exists:
        - Prompt user: "⚠️ {Item} already exists. Do you want to skip creation and reuse it? (Yes/No)"
        - Proceed based on response (skip or overwrite)
