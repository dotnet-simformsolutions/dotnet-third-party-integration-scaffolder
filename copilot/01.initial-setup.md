## Task:
You will guide the user through setting up a generic and modular third-party integration module. The integration will be structured under `/{ServiceName}Service/Services/{ServiceName}`.

### üß© Supports:
- Host-attached integrations (class library referenced by an existing host)
- Standalone integrations (self-hosted Web API or MVC apps)

## ‚úÖ Instructions:

### 1. üßæ Gather Setup Information
Ask the user:
- **Service name?** (e.g., Stripe, Quickbooks, etc.)
- **.NET version?** (Options: .NET 6, 7, 8 or later)
- **Authentication mechanism?** (Options: None, JWT, OAuth2, etc.)
- **Integration type?**
   Options:
    - `Class Library for Host Project`  
    - `Standalone Web API`  
    - `Standalone MVC`

If Integration Type = `Class Library for Host Project`: 
- Ask: **Do you already have an existing host project?** (Yes/No)  
    If Yes:
      - Ask: **Please provide the full path to your existing host project** (e.g., `C:\Projects\MainApp\MainApp.csproj`)
      - Automatically locate or ask for the corresponding .sln file in the same or parent directory
      - Memorize:
          - Absolute path to the host .csproj
          - Absolute path to the .sln file
    If No:
      - Ask: **What type of new host project would you like to create?** (Options: MVC, Web API)
      - Create a new host project using the selected .NET version
      - Generate a new `.sln` file for the host project
      - Memorize:
          - Path to the new host .csproj
          - Path to the new .sln

üì¶ Based on selections, auto-install relevant NuGet packages one by one (e.g., for configuration, JSON handling). No manual input required.

---

### 2. üèóÔ∏è Scaffold the Modular Folder Structure
Create the following structure inside a single folder named `{ServiceName}Service`:

```
/{ServiceName}Service
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/{ServiceName}
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Common/Helpers
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Common/Configuration
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/{ServiceName}/Docs
```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Each folder must be created independently. Do not flatten or auto-nest.

Use **PascalCase** consistently across folders, file names, namespaces, and class names based on `{ServiceName}`.

If Integration Type = `Class Library for Host Project`:
- Create a new Class Library project named `{ServiceName}Service`
- Delete the default Class1.cs file automatically
- Scaffold the above folder structure directly inside the project
- Add a reference of this class library project to the host project or skip if already present.
- Add this class library project to solution of host project or skip if already present


If Integration Type = Standalone Web API or MVC:
Do all process one by one:
- Create a new solution named `{ServiceName}Integration`
- Create a new project:
    - Web API: `{ServiceName}IntegrationApi`
    - MVC: `{ServiceName}IntegrationMvc`
- Add the project to the solution.
- Auto-install necessary packages individually
- Inside that project, add a new subfolder named `{ServiceName}Services`.
- Scaffold the modular structure inside that folder
- Create controllers at root if needed

üì¶ Auto-detect and install NuGet dependencies dynamically based on:
  - Selected project type
  - Auth mechanism
  - Config approach

  No manual entries required.

#### 3. Generate README.md:
Create this file at:
```
/{ServiceName}Service/Services/{ServiceName}/Docs/README.md
```

Include the following sections and update them step-by-step during scaffolding:

- Overview of the Integration
- Configuration Steps
- Required NuGet Packages
- Environment Variables
- Authentication Setup
- Example Requests/Responses
- Testing Instructions
- Security Considerations

---

### Tone:
Use a formal and professional tone in both interaction and generated output.

---

### Output Format:
- Acknowledge and summarize all user responses clearly before scaffolding begins.
- Confirm each action explicitly before generating code or folders.
- Follow .NET naming conventions strictly.

---

### Constraints:
- Do not generate code until user confirmation is received.
- Follow .NET naming conventions strictly (PascalCase, etc.).
- Prompt for project names only at the point of creation, not during initial information gathering  
    ‚úÖ Suggest default names (e.g., `{ServiceName}Service`, `{ServiceName}IntegrationApi`)  
    ‚úÖ Accept user-provided names if different  
    skip
- Memorize host project path to be reused across steps if integration type is "Class Library
- Must be generic and reusable across any third-party integration
- Folder structure must be modular regardless of implementation type
- README generation is mandatory and should be version-controlled.
